 * Provides action mechanism for agents.
 * <p>
 * Actions are task which can be requested by an agent to its parent. Usually are executed on invoking agent by parent
 * agent (f.e. agent migration, agent clone, agent die). Sometimes actions such as getting resources can be executed on
 * different agents.
 * Each agent structure change is proceeded by action executing. Actions are considered only for lightweight agents.
