 * A generic type of addresses used in AgE.

 * <li>an identifier;
 * <li>a user friendly name;
 * <li>the address of the node this address was created on.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The identifier and node address together distinguish addresses. The friendly name is not mandatory and should
 * have no impact on addressing logic.
 *
 * <p>Identity should be preserved across serialization (equals, hashcode).
